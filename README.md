## About

OB-Xd 2 is based on the legendary [Oberheim OB-X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberheim_OB-X). It attempts to recreate its sound and behavior, but as the original was very limited in some important ways, a number of features were added or altered to the original design.

### Key Features
- **Authentic sound recreation** with micro random detuning
- **Enhanced multimode filter**: Continuous blendable HP-Notch(BP)-HP in 12dB mode and 4-1 pole in 24dB mode
- **8-voice polyphony** with voice parameter controls
- **Multiple oscillator modes** including Saw, Square, Triangle, and Noise
- **Flexible modulation**: 2 ADSR envelopes, LFO, and mod matrix
- **MIDI learn** for easy controller mapping
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux
